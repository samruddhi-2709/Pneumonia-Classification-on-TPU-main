# Pneumonia Classification on TPU

This project focuses on classifying pneumonia from chest X-ray images using advanced deep learning models. The goal is to provide accurate and efficient diagnosis tools for resource-constrained environments.

Key Highlights:

* Implemented transfer learning with EfficientNet and VGGNet, achieving test accuracies of 98% and 92%, respectively.
* Developed a custom CNN model optimized using Kerastuner to automate hyperparameter tuning.
* Leveraged data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zooming) to enhance the dataset and prevent overfitting.
* Utilized TPUs on Google Colab for faster and more efficient model training.
  
Applications:
This project demonstrates the potential of deep learning in medical imaging, particularly for diagnosing pneumonia in areas with limited access to medical equipment and expertise.
