### Pneumonia Classification on Kaggle Dataset

This folder contains Python code files for performing pneumonia classification tasks using Kaggle's pneumonia dataset. The dataset comprises X-ray images of patients with and without pneumonia, sourced from Kaggle. Pneumonia is a common illness characterized by inflammation of the lungs, most commonly caused by bacterial or viral infections.

**Using the Kaggle API to Access the Dataset:**

1. **Install the Kaggle API:**
   ```bash
   pip install kaggle
   ```

2. **Set Up Kaggle API Credentials:**
   - Go to your Kaggle account settings page: [https://www.kaggle.com/account](https://www.kaggle.com/account)
   - Scroll down to the "API" section and click on "Create New API Token".
   - Place the downloaded `kaggle.json` file in the `.kaggle` directory in your user's home directory (e.g., `~/.kaggle/`).

3. **Download the Dataset Using the Kaggle API:**
   ```bash
   kaggle datasets download -d paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
   ```

4. **Extract the Dataset:**
   ```bash
   unzip chest-xray-pneumonia.zip
   ```

5. **Accessing the Dataset:**
   Once extracted, you can access the dataset files programmatically using libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or OpenCV, or manually by exploring the directories where the dataset is stored.
