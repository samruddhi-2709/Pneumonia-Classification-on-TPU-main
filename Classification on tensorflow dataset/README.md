### Pneumonia Classification on Tensorflow Dataset

This folder contains Python code files for performing pneumonia classification tasks using TensorFlow. The classification tasks utilize a dataset sourced from TensorFlow datasets, comprising X-ray images of patients with and without pneumonia. Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the small air sacs known as alveoli. It is typically caused by infection with viruses or bacteria and can be life-threatening, especially in vulnerable populations such as the elderly or those with weakened immune systems.
